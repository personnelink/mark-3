location for customers and staffing companies website

* web applications are not websites, personnel plus still needs a fully bonefied pretty website, that web server would it's root pointed at /_public/html/personnelplus (or something like that); ...

* ... and since we're hosting our own website, and running a 100% reliable and always up web service to our customers, well, we miles well just offer to host our customers website too and thus also giving us an extra in to integrate services AND giving the customer just one more reason to stay with us and not leave, when an employee eventually pisses them off or gets pissed off ...

* plus it's a nice service, most customers already have a website, not that hard to have them zip up and send up their files and then plug them in on our side, update some dns records, etc. ... so yeah, if and when we start offering that service as well, those files / sites would go here.
